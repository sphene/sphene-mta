# Sphene

**WORK IN PROGRESS**  
Sphene is an SCM runtime for Multi Theft Auto. Our goal is to add the ability to run the storyline on a Multi Theft Auto server. We then aim to add Co-Op capabilities on top of this.

### Sphene is in an EARLY development stage. You will experience a lot of crashes, and other unexpected behavior. It is not production ready. We only provide support for those who are actively trying to help with development.
